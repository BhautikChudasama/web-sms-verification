Verify phone numbers on the web with the SMS Receiver API

## What is SMS Receiver API

These days, most people in the world own a mobile device and developers are commonly using phone numbers as an identifier for users of their services.

There are a variety of ways to verify phone numbers, but a randomly generated one-time password (OTP) sent by SMS to the number is one of the most common. Sending this code back to the developer's server demonstrates control of the phone number.
